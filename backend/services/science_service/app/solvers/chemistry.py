Description: Elementary Chemistry & Physical Matter solver tailored specifically for Grade 1–3.
             Covers observable states of matter (Solid, Liquid, Gas), phase changes (melting,
             freezing, evaporation, condensation), and everyday mixing/dissolving.
             Includes robust LLM fallback (Gemini) when deterministic rules do not match.
